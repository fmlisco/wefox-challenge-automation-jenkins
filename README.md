# Http-echo

## Description
[Http echo] - A small go web server that serves the contents it was started with as an HTML page.


## Introduction

This chart deploys hello on a [Kubernetes] cluster using the [Helm 3] package manager and [Jenkins]

## Installing Minikube

To install Minikube if it's not available, run the script  **minikube_setup.sh** located in the root folder.

```console
$ bash minikube_setup.sh
```
The command checks, installs (if missing) and starts a minikube cluster named **wefox-challenge-cluster**
The [deploying](#Deploying) section lists the commands to deploy and upgrade the [Http echo](#Http-echo) helm chart.

> **Tip**: check minikube using `minikube status`

## Deploying the Jenkins helm chart

I deployed **Jenkins** to automate the deployment of **http-echo**
User: **admin**
password: **Wefoxchallenge01** 
```console
helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace devops-tools
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=devops-tools
helm upgrade --install jenkins-admin --set controller.adminPassword=Wefoxchallenge01 jenkins/jenkins
kubectl --namespace devops-tools port-forward svc/myjenkins 8080:8080 &
kubectl apply -f charts/jenkins/rbac.yaml
```
>**Tip**: I added a service account with the needed permissions to allow Jenkins to deploy/update our Helm Chart

## Configure the GitHub repository

I generated a Personal access token (**PAT**) in the GitHub settings and added a webhook in the GitHub repository that we are going to use (**[wefox-challenge-automation-jenkins](https://github.com/fmlisco/wefox-challenge-automation-jenkins)**)

## Define the URL for http-echo
```console
sudo -- sh -c "echo 127.0.0.1    hello.wefox.localhost >> /etc/hosts"
```

## Deploying 

I have already deployed the helm chart for **http-echo** with image version **0.2.1**.
as soon as a new git tag is created in the git repo, Github notifies Jenkins that runs the '**wefox-challenge**' pipeline and atuomatically deploys the **http-echo** helm chart.
>**Tip**: The git tag **must** match the image name since Jenkins uses it.
>
> **Tip**: The service should be available from outside the cluster, via something like:
> curl http://hello.wefox.localhost:8081/


## One line commands

### Minikube Dashboard
```console
minikube dashboard --url
```
>**Tip**: A great help to monitor the Minikube cluster

### Delete the minikube cluster
```console
minikube delete -p wefox-challenge-cluster
```
